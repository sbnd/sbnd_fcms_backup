# [Backup Component](http://fcms.sbnd.net/en/download/) 


================
With this component you can create a new database backup or revert/restore an old database version without using a MySQL client. You can also set a cronjob for these activities.

The component only has a backend part, accessible from the administration panel form: domain/cp.

1) Unpack "backup-v.1.1" in the site root or copy the files from the archive in their coresponding folders in the site root.
	For Example:
	All .php files (located in: \cmp) have to be placed in cmp folder (located in:\cmp) of the site root.

2) Create a component (Go to Control Panel(cp) -> System -> Components -> Add) and set the following values:

	2.1) sytem name 			-> back-up
	2.2) PHP Class Name 			-> cmp/back/Backup
	2.3) public name 			-> Backup
	2.4) Participate in Admin Menu Group 	-> check
	
3) Include lingual variables:

	3.1) Go to Control Panel(cp) -> System -> Languages -> "Import from a File" (default English version is provided)
	3.2) choose en.ini file
	3.3) click "Import from file"
		 
4) In order for the Backup component to work a cron job that executes services/autobackup.php must be created. The service can also be accessed here: http://your_site_name/index.php?ajax=autobackup.

That is all :)
